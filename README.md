# ProjectLambda

Welcome to Project Lambda, a Zoom app where users can create, join, edit and delete Zoom meetings for their organization! Multiple views provide different ways to visualize meeting schedules and search for time ranges and/or colleagues. Users can also manage groups of frequently contacted colleagues, as well as start instant meetings with group members in one-click.

Check out the deployed project [here](https://zoom-dashboard.tk). Please note this deployment will no longer be hosted by January 2023.
